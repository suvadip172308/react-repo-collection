# React-Query-Axios
### Simple CRUD Todo App With React Query and Axios

You can see the app on: **https://react-query-axios.netlify.app/**

This just for you who currently trying to understanding React-Query, this a simple example how to use React-Query on GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoint and integrated with Axios..

On React-Query, for GET endpoint you use useQuery hook, but if your method modifies data on the server (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc), you better use useMutation hook.

I get the free API from this repo: https://github.com/ndraaditiya/public-api-crud-todoApp
